# üìù Consumer Complaints Analysis

In this project, I analyzed consumer complaints data to gain insights into common issues faced by consumers and how they communicate these complaints to companies.

## üìä Data Cleaning
First, I cleaned the data by:
- Checking for **duplicate values** and **null values**.
- Removing **unimportant columns** to streamline the dataset.
