# üñ•Ô∏è Developer Survey Analysis

In this analysis, I explored survey data from developers, focusing on coding experience, demographics, employment status, education, and the tools they use. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of my findings:

## üßπ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
1. **Initial Columns**: The dataset initially contained **84 columns**. I removed all non-essential columns, reducing it to only **12 columns** relevant for analysis.
   
2. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Filled the **YearsCode** and **Age1stCode** columns with the median values.
   - Identified columns with around **20%** of data as null and opted to remove them for simplicity.

3. **Coding Experience Insights**:
   - The average age at which respondents started coding is **15 years or younger**.
   - **80%** of respondents started coding by the age of **20**.
   - The mean number of years spent coding is **12**, with **80%** having coded for up to **20 years**.
