# 🚀 Data Analysis Projects

These are 4 data analysis projects I completed during my learning journey with Python. While these projects were done some time ago, they played a crucial role in helping me understand various concepts in data analysis.

### 🧹 Data Cleaning 
    - Applied techniques for handling missing values, outliers, and transforming data into usable formats.

### 📊 Important Python Libraries
    - Utilized libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and more for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Gained insights from datasets using statistical methods and visualizations.

### 🎓 Learning Focus
    These projects helped me dive deeper into:
    Data preprocessing techniques
    Effective data visualization
    Improving data analysis workflows
