# 🚀 Data Analysis Projects

These are **4 data analysis projects** I completed during my learning journey with Python. Though they were created some time ago, they significantly contributed to my understanding of essential **data analysis** concepts.

### 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Applied techniques for handling **missing values**, **outliers**, and transforming data into usable formats.

### 📊 Important Python Libraries
- Utilized libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and more for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Gained insights from datasets using statistical methods and visualizations.

### 🎓 Learning Focus
These projects helped me dive deeper into:
- **Data preprocessing** techniques
- Effective **data visualization**
- Improving **data analysis workflows**
